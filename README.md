# PowerBi_Sales_2
Back with another learning session on data analytics and visualization with Power BI. Right now in this repository I'm utilizing the superstore sales dataset to analyze some of the main findings from the dataset.

### Method
The data is contained in a Microsoft Excel file (.xlsx) which can be pulled directly and easily into Power BI. The data is clean with no empty / missing values and all of the columns are already in their correct formats. No further editing or cleaning done before importing the data into Power BI.

### Dashboard
Making charts is relatively easy and it can tell us a lot about the data itself that might be missed when looking at the raw data alone.

### Information and Insight
1. In 2015, the store generated more than 4M USD in sales and more than 500K USD in profit. This means the store gained around 12.5% profit from its sales, which is genrally safe but it certainly can improve.
2. The store gained more sales (and profit) in the 4th quarter. This is a proven seasonality of the store's sales since the same pattern occured since 2012.

3. There are 3 main categories of products being sold in the store. Technology is the most profitable one, bringing in more than 230K USD of profit in 2015.
4. Specifically, the sub-category copiers is the most profitable one. The store sold 2642 units of copiers in 2015 and profited 104K USD from it. That means for each copiers sold, each of them brought in 39 USD on average.
5. On the other hand, the furniture category is the least profitable one. With roughly the same units of products sold as technology, furniture only generated a little less than 90K USD in 2015.
6. Tables (one of the subcategories in furniture) is the only category in sold in the store bringing in **loss** of 30K USD.
7. Interestingly, the only market that generated profit for table sales is the Africa market which has the lowest quantity of tables ordered. Tables sold in the Asia Pacific market generated the biggest loss of 10K USD.

8. Still on the topic of tables, the shipping cost for tables seems to be negativelt correlated to the profit made from selling them. It's shown in the chart below that, on average, shipping tables to Africa costs 60 USD where each tables generated around 120 USD in profit.
